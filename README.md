# RippleEffect
Want to upgrade your website to a more modern look and feel? No JavaScript experience necessary, just add the files, copy and paste 2 lines and add the class "rippleJs" to whatever object you want! 

Add this to your html page:  
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="rippleCss.css" type="text/css">
<script src ="rippleJs.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
Now add the class rippleJs to any object that you want to have this effect.
```
A Button:
<button class="rippleJs" type="button">A Button</button>

or a normal div:
<div class="rippleJs">Normal Div</div>             
```
