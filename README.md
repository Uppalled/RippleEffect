# RippleEffect
Want to upgrade your website to a more modern look and feel? You can do that easily by upgrading your buttons using the Ripple framework! No JavaScript experience necessary, just add the files, copy and paste 2 lines and add the class "rippleJs" to whatever object you want! 

Add this to your html page:  
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="rippleCss.css" type="text/css">
<script src ="rippleJs.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
Special thanks to Johan Sundman as this was based off of his ripple effect project https://github.com/JohanSundman/ripple-button
